            <p>Weary and exhausted, Ramavati Devi feeds her one-year-old grandson and keeps an eye on another as she
                waits for her
                son and seven-month pregnant daughter-in-law under the shade of a Metro pillar near the Anand Vihar Bus
                Terminal. A
                Delhi Police constable drives away Devi, and many others who have gathered to cross over to Uttar
                Pradesh, to
                another border crossing a kilometer away. She moves away from the spot near a petrol pump, but not too
                far as he is
                waiting for her son.</p>
